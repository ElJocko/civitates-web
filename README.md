Civitates Web is a web application that provides an online, interactive historical atlas for the ancient and medieval worlds.
Its focus is on the cities that existed between 1600 BC and 1600 AD.
It is a work-in-progress, currently containing cities across the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
More cities are being gradually added over time.

City data for this app is maintained in the [Civitates Data](https://github.com/ElJocko/civitates-data) repository.
